About Project :

It is a trading pattern detector which will detect the pattern of the candle stick graph based on the previous data.


Setup:

First of all you need to set the path of the sample data and ground truth csv files in the program. 
After that you need to run the training code to generate labelled images.
Once it is done you need to run the final code to get the output.csv as the output which will cointain the date, time and the predicted pattern.



for Basic code Explaination and implementation logic refer to Helping Document
